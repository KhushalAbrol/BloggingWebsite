                        Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
                        And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
                        To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
                        He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
                        To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
                        But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
                        Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
                        I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
                        To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
                        I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,

                    Textummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the final publication is not compromised.
